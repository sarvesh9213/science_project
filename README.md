Added interactive SHM Simulator with visual pendulum and displacement graph

- Built responsive HTML/CSS UI with Montserrat font and gradient background
- Integrated MathJax to render mathematical formulas for SHM theory
- Defined SHM parameters: Amplitude, Frequency, and Damping
- Implemented pendulum animation using canvas and JavaScript
- Plotted real-time displacement vs. time graph
- Added equations for displacement, acceleration, and angular frequency
- Included damping effect for realistic oscillation behavior
